## Diablo 2 / D2R Bossq and Monster Drop Simulator

The drop simulator uses item type and quality generating functions and data files from D2 (TreasureClassEx.txt, ItemRatio.txt, ...) to reproduce the game's random loot drop mechanic.
- The code is open source and available [here](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apairofdocs%2Fd2-drop-simulator+language%3APython&type=Code)
- Play here: https://pairofdocs.github.io/d2-dropsim-web/
